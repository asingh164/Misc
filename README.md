# Miscellaneous Resources

This is page of resources that I have found useful and wanted to put somewhere for safe keeping 

### Plotting and Graphics 
[Colour-Hex](https://www.color-hex.com) - Nice webpage to explore colours for plotting. Has nice colour palettes, colour wheels etc.
[getopts](https://github.com/asingh164/Misc/blob/master/getopts.parsing.arguments.code.txt) - Nice snippet of code for parsing user inputted arguments in a bash      program
